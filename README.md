# cafe-delivery-bot
This is my first project - Telegram bot for  delivery service of small restaraunt. 
It has been made with Python and aiogram.
What can this bot do?
Well, for user it has:
1. Registration process - after you registrate once, then you don't need to enter your data all the time (delivery address, name, phone).
Although you have all the posibilities to change your data if you enter the wrong one. Also you can add details straight to your order.
2. Inline buttons to comfrotable use with menu and each item in it.
3. Online payments.
For admin it has:
0. /admin command
0.1 admins are the users in .env ADMIN_IDS var.
1. Comfortable admin panel where you can load/edit/delete items from the menu. 
2. Also you can send mass dm /massdm.
3. You as admin get the message when someone makes an order.
4. You also get notifications when somebody pays online for his order.
Well.
The project uses 3 different databases in sqlite just for example. I should change the names of the databases inside of project to only one database's name
And just made a different tables. I know about it.
The project are ready to work.
